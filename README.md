## Summary
*Include a brief summary that describes your system that your are modelling*
The above code is a simulation of a food delivery service system. It includes classes such as Food, FastFood, OrganicFood, Order, and Menu which model the different components of the system. The simulation starts by creating food objects such as pizza, burger, and sandwich, as well as organic versions of those foods. These foods are then added to a menu for a fast food restaurant and an organic food restaurant. The simulation then prompts the user for their information and allows them to add items to their order. The order summary and total cost of the order is then printed out, and the food items are cooked. The simulation ends by closing the scanner.
